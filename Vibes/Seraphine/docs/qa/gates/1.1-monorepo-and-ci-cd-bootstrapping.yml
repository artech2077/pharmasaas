  - severity: high
    summary: 'CI skips building/uploading the standalone API artifact'
    details: '.github/workflows/ci.yml:89-102 only publishes Next.js outputs; no @pharmasaas/api dist is generated for downstream consumers.'

  - severity: medium
    summary: 'Web workspace still lacks meaningful tests'
    details: 'apps/web/tests/unit/sample.test.ts is a placeholder, leaving the health route and core scaffolding without automated coverage.'

  future:
    - action: 'Replace the web placeholder test with meaningful coverage (e.g., health route smoke test).'
