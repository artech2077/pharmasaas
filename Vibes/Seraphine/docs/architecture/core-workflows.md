**Rationale**
- Trade-offs: Treated Convex as external API to highlight auth/usage boundaries; ensures plan factors vendor lock-in mitigation. Sequence diagram focuses on reconciliation since itâ€™s most critical workflow; future diagrams can capture inventory intake once supplier integrations mature. Assumed offline events replay through Convex to avoid exposing raw Postgres externally.
- Assumptions: Clerk webhooks drive role changes, so backend must handle them idempotently. Convex tokens expire quickly; service worker refreshes via `/api/auth/convex-token` endpoint. Resend handles PDF links pointing to R2 objects signed via temporary URLs.
- Validation: Confirm legal review approves EU-hosted Clerk/Resend; ensure pharmacy-specific email templates meet compliance copy before go-live.
