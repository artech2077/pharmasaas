# Security and Performance

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://js.clerk.com https://js.convex.dev; connect-src 'self' https://api.pharmasaas.com https://*.convex.cloud https://api.resend.com; img-src 'self' data: https://res.cloudinary.com; frame-src https://clerk.com`
- XSS Prevention: React auto-escaping, `dompurify` for AI-generated HTML, lint rule forbidding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Secure Storage: Clerk-managed session cookies (httpOnly, SameSite=Lax); IndexedDB cache encrypted via WebCrypto AES-GCM

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schemas for every handler + Drizzle type-safety
- Rate Limiting: Upstash Redis sliding window per IP/tenant (default 60 req/min, burst 120)
- CORS Policy: Allow staging/production origins explicitly; deny wildcard
- Network Segmentation: Leverage Vercel project-level firewall rules and Neon branch access controls; restrict direct DB access to GitHub Actions + Railway via IP allowlists. All internal traffic forced over TLS 1.3.
- Secret Rotation: Secrets stored in Doppler; automated rotation every 90 days with staged rollout (staging â†’ production). Clerk/Resend keys rotated immediately upon role changes.

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Clerk session tokens only; short-lived Convex tokens minted per request
- Session Management: 12h lifetime with inactivity timeout; owner role requires 2FA enforced by Clerk
- Password Policy: Clerk policy (min 12 chars, complexity), enforced plus mandatory MFA for finance actions

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <350 KB gzipped on dashboard route
- Loading Strategy: React Server Components + Suspense skeletons; defer charts until interaction
- Caching Strategy: TanStack Query SWR + service worker precache for shell assets and offline queue

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <500 ms p95 for operational APIs; <5 s for report export
- Database Optimization: Composite indexes on `(tenant_id, status)`, nightly vacuum; materialized views for dashboards refreshed via worker
- Caching Strategy: Redis cache for KPI aggregates (TTL 30s) + Neon read replica for analytics/Metabase
- Backup Encryption: Neon logical dumps encrypted with AES-256 via KMS; R2 backup buckets enforce server-side encryption and strict access policies. Railway worker encrypts model artifacts before upload.

**Rationale**
- Trade-offs: CSP tuned tightly to vendors in use; may require update when adding analytics vendors. Offline encryption adds complexity but satisfies NFR around sensitive financial data stored locally during outages.
- Assumptions: WebCrypto available on target browsers; Upstash plan handles throttle limits for MVP volume.
