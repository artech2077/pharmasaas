# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Deliver a calm, data-rich cockpit letting pharmacists assess cash position, profits, and inventory health within seconds. Guided workflows feel like a checklist companion, reducing mental load during reconciliation and ordering. Visual hierarchy spotlights actionable alerts and AI recommendations without overwhelming.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Step-by-step reconciliation assistant with progress indicators.
- Contextual drawers/modals for resolving discrepancies and logging adjustments.
- Command palette or quick actions for power users to jump to reports, forecasts, and ordering.
- Inline AI insights (forecast cards, reorder prompts) embedded throughout dashboards and product lists.

## Core Screens and Views
- Secure login and onboarding wizard.
- Daily operations dashboard (cash status, profit, alerts, forecast cards).
- Reconciliation workflow (wizard: cash count → discrepancy resolution → confirmation).
- Inventory and supplier management (catalog table with filters, batch/expiry details, reorder prompts).
- Sales and reports hub (financial reports, exports, compliance documents).
- Settings and team roles (user management, permissions, audit trail access).

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1, keyboard navigability, and status messages with textual alternatives.

## Branding
Professional, trustworthy palette (pharmacy greens/blues) with subtle Moroccan cues—tile-inspired accents and typography. MVP assumes no strict brand guide; later phases can add per-pharmacy theming.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop with responsive layouts for tablets and mobile browsers—critical actions (reconciliation, alerts) remain usable on 7" screens.
