# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
“As ux-expert, create the front-end spec for PharmaSaaS using docs/prd.md. Focus on POS workflow (USB scanning), reconciliation assistant, inventory management, and forecasts dashboard. Highlight guided flows, accessibility (WCAG AA), and French localization expectations.”

## Architect Prompt
“As architect, craft the fullstack architecture for PharmaSaaS using project-brief.md and docs/prd.md. Honor the monorepo + modular monolith plan, Clerk auth, Convex real-time layer, and forecasting pipeline requirements. Call out data model boundaries, offline strategy, and observability stack.”
