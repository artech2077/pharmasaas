# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a unified SaaS that replaces fragmented pharmacy tools with one workflow-centric platform.
- Cut daily cash-reconciliation effort from 2+ hours to under 15 minutes using guided automation.
- Provide real-time profitability and inventory intelligence tailored to Moroccan pharmacies.
- Enable accurate short-term demand forecasting to reduce stockouts and overstock.
- Ensure compliance-ready financial reporting and audit trails from day one.

## Background Context
Moroccan pharmacists juggle separate systems for sales, inventory, and accounting, forcing hours of manual reconciliation and leaving profitability opaque. Generic POS or ERP products miss pharmacy-specific workflows, while disconnected tools introduce errors and stress. PharmaSaaS addresses this by delivering an AI-driven, French-first platform that centralizes operations, automates reconciliation, and offers proactive inventory and cash-flow insights. The MVP prioritizes core reconciliation, profit tracking, and forecasting to prove value quickly within tight budget and timeline constraints.
